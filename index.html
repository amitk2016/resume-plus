          Our top résumé writers have actually worked in the industries in which they specialise. We therefore know how to create a résumé that meets the expectations of employers, for example, using the same industry language demonstrates that you are an expert in your field. This attention to detail will ensure your résumé gets the respect it deserves.

        <!-- <p class="text-center" style="width:650px;font-size:16px;margin:0 auto;">
          These same writers can also apply their industry experience and knowledge to assist business owners with the production of professional documents such as sales proposals, project plans, RFP responses, and so on. Whilst our writers focus on these documents, business owners can get on with what they need to, i.e. running their business. Check out our Plus services for a summary of additional service offerings.

                      Peter has over 40 years of work experience in the IT industry. He has worked within technical and managerial roles, and in the recruitment industry as a consultant. He has successfully placed candidates in a number of industry segments, including IT, finance, accounting, and hospitality.  Peter has worked with many job seekers, from recent graduates to workforce veterans, reviewing their résumés and assisting with directly targeting employer requirements. He sees that the employers’ first impressions of résumés and cover letters essentially act as a first interview with a job seeker. In the cutthroat world of recruitment, job applicants need tailored documents to engage employers and elevate themselves above the competition.
